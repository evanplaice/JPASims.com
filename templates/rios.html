  <div class="p1" style="display:inline;font-weight:bold;">The illustration at the left is the page which appears once the IOS PC is booted and is awaiting the IOS program to load and begin executing.  A customer's logo, aircraft type, as well as additional  illustrative items can be programmed for this display. Once the IOS program is executing, activating the Touch button on the screen will transition the corresponding IOS display to its programmed Default page.
  <br />
  <br />
  Each of the displays will have this activation page and will have it's own, individually programmed Default page...typically, Display 1 will default to the Main Menu page while Display 2 will default to the Map Page.  Depending on customer preference, any page in the IOS System may be programmed as the Default page for each Display.</div><br /><br />

<div class="p1" style="display:box;">The <span style="font-weight:bold;color:blue;">TouchScreen Displays</span> are manufactured by ELO Touch Systems, a subsidiary of TYCO Electronics.   These displays have been utilized with this IOS System on 8 simulator installations, for a total of some 21 years of accumulated operational use with zero failures.  The displays are completely off-the-shelf, low cost units which ELO has supported well for several decades.  Typical to this IOS System are matching 19" TouchScreen Displays, however a full range of displays from 12" up to 24" are available.  Installation of the TouchScreens can either be accomplished as a "Workshare" project with the customer installing the TouchScreens, or JPA will coordinate with Sim-X Ltd to provide fabrication and installation needs.  The TouchScreens can be installed in a temporary fashion in the cockpit and left to operate in this manner until the customer feels any acceptance, regression testing, or other testing is complete and it is deemed time to remove the original IOS system.  A Technical Specification Sheet can be found later in this brochure.</div>
<div class="p1">The <span style="font-weight:bold;color:blue;">IOS PC</span> is an industrial rack mount computer with a Pentium processor powerful enough so that no discernable delays are noted by the Instructor/Operator while in use.  The PC is produced by Industrial Computers Incorporated (ICI) of Ann Arbor, Michigan.  JPA has exclusively utilized ICI in projects from LTN-92, TCAS, EGPWS and others for over 15 years.  During this time, ICI computers utilized on JPA projects have logged an accumulated total of over 175 years of simulator-related operation with zero defects.  All internal components such as Serial Port and Video PCB's are off-the-shelf, inexpensive components selected for their durability and performance.  A 1000 watt UPS system is provided for powering the IOS PC and peripherals, and can be utilized to power the onboard TouchScreens as well, if the customer wishes.</div>
<div class="p1">The <span style="font-weight:bold;color:blue;">Data Communications</span> are handled by a Local and Remote KVM Booster system.  Between the Computer Room and Cockpit, CAT V lines will transmit the video and serial TouchScrreen data.  The video format is RGB whole the touch function is by serial data communications.</div>
<div class="p1">The <span style="font-weight:bold;color:blue;">Software Package</span> runs in a Windows XP environment.  The Main RIOS executable is generated by Delphi 2006 software development tools.  The pages themselves can be modified without recompiling the main executable.  Once a change is made in the Page File, only a restart of the RIOS is needed to view the results of the changes.</div>

<ul>
  <li>Radio Aids Auto-Compiler which operates as a Radio Aids Server, offloading computing responsibilities from the host</li>
  <li>QTG System with Test Result displays on the Touchscreens, or IOS operation of testing only</li>
  <li>A Variety of enhanced maintenance aids for on-screen operation and display of Simulator RealTime Debug programs</li>
  <li>Panel only TouchScreen Installations or Combination Panel/Instructor Seat Touchscreens Installations</li>
  <li>Networking of multiple RIOS's for common updating of common pages</li>
