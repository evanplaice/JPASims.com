<div class="p1">The Avionics update project at Atlas consists of updates to Navigation and Warning systems on both the 747-200 #1 simulator and the 747-200 #2 simulator.  The updates are designed and installed as "Bolt-On" solutions.  Only panel lighting control and the aural speaker system are utilized from the original simulator systems.  The upgrade software and I/O are contained within a single PC.</div>
<div class="p1">The Avionics upgrade PC is connected via an Ethernet device in the host computer.  In the case of one of the simulators, this meant installing an Ethernet driver in a SEL (Gould) 32/77 Host computer.  This is often quoted as being an impossible configuration since that version of MPX did not support Ethernet and no driver was or is provided by the manufacturer.  It is indeed not impossible, as this is the 4th such 32/77 in which JPA has installed an Ethernet card and driver.</div>
<div class="p1">The major avionics updates provided were:

<div class="h2">LTN-92 Installation</div>
<div class="p1">The simulators had previously operated with Carousel IV or Litton 72 INS systems.  The LTN-92 conversion was designed and installed as a "Bolt-On" system.  Over 200,000 lines of code operate in the Host computer to emulate the INU and manage interfacing with the cockpit CDU's.  GPS has been added as a feature to support navigation requirements of the INS.  Only lightplate supply was integrated into the original simulator systems.</div>
<div class="h2">TAWS Installation</div>
<div class="p1">The simulators needed to be modified to match the aircraft installations of the Sandel TAWS system.  Once again, JPA opted for the "Bolt-On" solution.  The TAWS emulation was hosted in the Avionics Update PC and interfacing hardware installed in the PC as well.  This brought the PC to a point of hosting both the LTN-92 and TAWS systems.  Only the simulator speaker system was used for TAWS audio outputs.</div>
<div class="h2">TCAS Rehosting and Update</div>
<div class="p1">There was a concern on Atlas's part, as is common in the industry, about the proliferation of multiple PCs on the simulator.  In order to reduce that concern, JPA rehosted the TCAS system onto the JPA Avionics PC and updated some of the I/O hardware during the rehosting.  Some of the TCAS operating software was updated to improve reliability and reduce some intermittent problems experiences over the years of operation.</div>
<div class="p1">JPA has become proficient in the use of PC technology and Ethernet connectivity to keep simulator updates at a minimum cost.  With the use of this approach, JPA was able to keep the simulator "Out of Service" time to <b>Zero.</b> Three major avionics system now operate on one PC, with dedicated, maintenance friendly Interface units and newly fabricated cables completing the system.  </div>
